## üîÑ Migration from Old Structure

The old scattered structure has been consolidated:

- **vector_basics/** ‚Üí **01_sequential_containers_basics.cpp**
- **vector_element_safety_test/** ‚Üí **02_container_safety_and_access.cpp**
- **associative_containers_example/** ‚Üí **03_associative_containers.cpp**
- **adapters/** ‚Üí **04_container_adapters.cpp**
- **string-conversions/** + **strings-operations/** ‚Üí **05_string_operations.cpp**
- **algorithms-and-search/** ‚Üí **06_algorithms_and_search.cpp**
- **container-ops/** + **examples/** ‚Üí **07_advanced_container_operations.cpp**

This new structure provides a more logical learning progression while maintaining all the important concepts from the original files.
